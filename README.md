## ✨ Overview

**ResuScan** is a full-stack, browser-based AI resume analyzer. Upload your resume, match it against job descriptions, and receive AI-driven feedback on how to improve your chances - all without leaving the browser.

This project combines modern front-end tools like React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with Puter.js, a powerful serverless SDK, to build a seamless, secure, and scalable app - no backend required.

---

## 🧠 Why I Built It

I wanted to create a tool that not only simplifies resume screening but also demonstrates the significant advancements in client-side web development. With Puter.js, you can handle auth, file uploads, and even AI interactions directly from the front end. This project was a great opportunity to explore serverless architecture and user-centred design.
